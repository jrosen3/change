        JCC is a C++ code generator for producing the code necessary to call
        into Java classes from CPython via Java's Native Invocation Interface (JNI).
        
        JCC generates C++ wrapper classes that hide all the gory details of JNI
        access as well Java memory and object reference management.
        
        JCC generates CPython types that make these C++ classes accessible from a
        Python interpreter. JCC attempts to make these Python types pythonic by
        detecting iterators and property accessors. Iterators and mappings may also
        be declared to JCC.
        
        JCC has been built on Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 and has been used with
        various Java Runtime Environments such as Sun Java 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6, Apple's
        Java 1.4 and 1.5 on Mac OS X and open source Java OpenJDK 1.7 builds.
        
        An experimental port to Python 3 is available from a branch:
          http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/pylucene/branches/python_3/jcc/
        
        JCC is supported on Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris and Windows.
        
        JCC is written in C++ and Python. It uses Java's reflection API to do its
        job and needs a Java Runtime Environment to be present to operate.
        
        JCC is built with distutils or setuptools::
        
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        Setuptools is required to build JCC on Python 2.3.
        
        Except for Mac OS X - where Apple's Java comes pre-installed in a known
        framework location - JCC's setup.py file needs to be edited before building
        JCC to specify the location of the Java Runtime Environment's header files
        and libraries.
        
        The svn sources for JCC are available at:
          http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/pylucene/trunk/jcc/
